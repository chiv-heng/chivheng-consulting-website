              <p>Just as often, I uncover gaps in institutional knowledge, gaps in team capacity, and the distinction

                is part of a holistic approach to moving from chaos to clarity.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="about-lead">I bring 15 years of hands-on leadership at two charter public school networks, scaling
                operations,
                technology, and data systems during rapid growth. I learned what works for a small school of a few
                hundred but quickly breaks at 2,000 students—and which systems create distractions versus which actually
                help educators focus on students instead of spreadsheets.</p>
              <p>I've lived the operational challenges you're facing. I know what it's like to inherit broken systems,
                to translate between tech teams and school leaders, to build something that actually works for the
                people using it.</p>
              <p>Now I partner with mission-driven organizations to do the same work I did internally: implement
                systems, coach teams, and build lasting capacity.</p>

              <div class="about-story">
                <h3>What's the funny symbol in my name?</h3>
                <p>The symbol and my name represent an intersection of cultural heritage and my approach. My name, which
                  is pronounced like "chew" (rather than "chive" or rhyming with "shiv"), is Cambodian. I am the first
                  U.S.-born child of Cambodian refugees. I didn't love having a funny name growing up here, but came to
                  embrace it as an adult.</p>
                <p>The symbol is inspired by the unalome, a Buddhist symbol representing the path from chaos to
                  enlightenment. It felt fitting for work that's ultimately about helping organizations move from
                  reactive chaos to clarity through better systems and internal capacity.</p>
